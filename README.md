# 1. Power BI Interface Navigation
## Load data and transform data in PBI

**Loading data:** move data from a source to another place (in this case is PBI)

**Transforming data: involve doing some editing and changing with Power Query Editor and THEN, it will load the data in PBI** 

>ðŸ’¡ Note with the PBI interface: the report view doesnâ€™t have anything, so click the table view below.

# Model view

- It will be useful to have them when you have multiple tables and you want to connect them.

# Exercises

Question 1: where do spend the least amount of money buying the exact same products? â‡’ (easier to identify the cheapest price)

Now that we see clearly that not every product at Costco is cheaper than the other supermarkets.

Since the rice and Canned Vegetables at Target are cheaper.

# 2. Power Query
> ðŸ’¡ Unpivot Columns in Power Query means turning column headers into row values, so your data becomes longer instead of wider â€” making it easier to analyze.
> 

âœ… Use it when you have repeated column names like months, subjects, or categories, and you want them all in **one column** instead.
